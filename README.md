# PHA-Data-Science-Challenge

The challenge or the business problem was to predict the hourly demand for taxis in the Bronx area and determine the optimal number of taxis required to meet this demand

The five parts of the challenge was solved using Machine learning algorithms in Python
The steps followed for Model Development are:
  1. Data Cleaning and Processing
  2. Feature Engineering
  3. Feature Selection
  4. Model Selection
  5. Model Development
  6. Model Evaluation

### For the Baseline model, Simple Moving Average was used to predict the demand in Bronx Area. 
### For an Improved Model, Linear Regression proved better in comparison to XGBoost, Random Forest and other algorithms .Linear Regression gave better model performance in terms of MAE.MSE and R-squared
### For choosing the best model, Lasso Regression performed slightly better in comparison to Ridge Regression and Linear Regreesion with better model performance.

### To solve the task of predicting the demand for first week of September, I used the best model : Lasso Regression to predict the demand. The results are present in Forecast_Sept_firstweek.csv

### Optimal Taxi was the last part of the challenge in which different assumption were used to predict the outcome. The assumption and constraints used are mentioned in detail in the Report( PHA DS Challenege Report PPT) Slide 8

Challenge Solved!
